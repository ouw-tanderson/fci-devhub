# Getting Started


Before implementing/optimizing anything, review all task comments for important notes. Deliverables are no longer auto-approvedâ€”location approval is required before implementation.

 - Deliverables: Must be reviewed and approved by the client before implementation.
 - Important: Do not proceed with any implementation for FCI of Houston Memorial without explicit client approval.
