# Home Page Optimization

Home page optimization is a crucial part of the Local Marketing Strategy for Floor Coverings International. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating/editing/deleting content on local location home pages. This guide also provides short codes that can be used in the process for creating a page. 

## Getting Started
Before implementing anything, review all task comments for important notes. Review Condario strategy for comments from client.

- Verify the correct page with the territory (some names are similar) and NOT a geopage or materialsPage.
- Edit by clicking “Home” in the left column, _not the three dots &rarr; Open page editor._
- There will be no content. Don’t add an HTML code module or a Template component module.
- Title and Meta descriptions **for local home pages specifically** can _only_ be updated via a spreadsheet. Place your title and meta description in the correct row/columns of [this spreadsheet](https://oneupweb.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/FloorCoveringsInternationalExternal/EWRF3QPQuG1Ei97xeEAV-WUBaN4rpiNVHh6p_6o6aOYAIg?e=IwPV8h).
- Under Site &rarr; Custom Fields,
  - **Branch Hero Title:** Your H1 heading from the Word Doc.
  - **Rich Text Heading:** First paragraph’s H2 heading
  - **Rich Text Body:**
    - Paste everything after the first paragraph **heading** into the Word2HTML tool. Click Clean. Adjust H2, etc.
    - Paste the HTML template component after clicking the [Source] <> button and clearing the contents.
> **Saving Tip - Draft Save**
>
> You can save your work as a draft at any time by clicking the Save Draft button in the upper right corner. This lets you return to your edits later without publishing, and helps prevent data loss if your browser crashes.
>
{style="note"}
  - Blue Save button in the lower right corner.
- Publish the page using “Save and Publish” under the Save Draft dropdown.
- View the live page under the Preview dropdown.
- Put the live link in [the implementation tracker OneNote doc](https://oneupweb.sharepoint.com/sites/localmarketing/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b5b70e07d-8986-4311-b652-89f81c07c4fc%7d&action=edit&wd=target%28Implementation.one%7C63218e3a-35e4-44ee-9d32-0d2eebc94973%2FImplementation%20Tracker%20for%20Speed%7Ce61d5783-3283-4ddb-9c36-af6c8ecb65ef%2F%29&wdorigin=NavigationUrl) and in the task comment when you tag Tyler.
- Mark the task as Implemented by adding to the Implemented board.
- Person who QAs the page will update the board from Implemented to QA Complete once QA is finished. Board will close the task out. Continue to document with a comment on the task and update status of deliverable in the [Local Strategy Tracker](https://oneupweb.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/client-floorcoveringsinternational/EfKwXOnspC5KvtM0KhJasMEBnPwhZBG3vZKykoTFTr2E-w?e=KhmanZ)
