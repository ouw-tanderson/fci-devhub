- Create from scratch.
    - Add a new page “Blank Normal Page”

- The next block is a Component Template – HTML dropdown.
    - This content is the top heading and paragraph
    - Paste it into the Word2HTML tool. Click Clean. Adjust H2, etc.
    - Paste the HTML template component after clicking the [Source] <> button and clearing the contents.
