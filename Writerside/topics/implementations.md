# Implementations


## General Notes
Before implementing floor plans, review all task comments for important notes. Deliverables are no longer auto-approvedâ€”location approval is required before implementation.

 - Deliverables: Must be reviewed and approved by the client before implementation.
 - Important: Do not proceed with any implementation for FCI of Houston Memorial without explicit client approval.
 - Final step: Ensure the Condario Sync tag is added to the task before closing.
